hive-mongo
==========

the mongo storage handler for the hive 


##CAUSION:

* currently only support Hive primitive types: string, int, smallint....

* Whitespace should not be used in between entries in the "mongo.columns.mapping" string, since these will be interperted as part of the column name, which is not what you want.

* if you want "insert overwrite" feature, you must have a field named be mapped to "_id" field (Object Id in MongoDB collections).
